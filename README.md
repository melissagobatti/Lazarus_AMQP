# Lazarus_AMQP
AMQP protocol based on now massively fragmented https://github.com/delphiripper/comotobo

I was looking for full source AMQP for Delphi and after a ton of digging found one that seemed to be close to functional.  Then I found there were 13 forks and multiple old PR's.

I tried a few forks, some better than others but none actually functional (many wouldn't even compile).

So far this appears 100% functional under Delphi 10.4 with RabbitMQ 3.9.9 on top of Erlang/OTP 24.1.5

I've only been testing the features I need at this point.

Tested in FMX, working there as well.  Over the next few weeks I'll be using this project in Android/Win64 and Win32
